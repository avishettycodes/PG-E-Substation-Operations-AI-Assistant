# Pushing to GitHub

Follow these steps to push your PG&E Substation Operations Assistant to GitHub:

## 1. Create a new repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign in to your account
2. Click on the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository"
3. Name your repository (e.g., "pge-substation-assistant")
4. Add a description (optional)
5. Choose whether to make it public or private
6. Do NOT initialize with a README, .gitignore, or license (we've already created these locally)
7. Click "Create repository"

## 2. Connect your local repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show commands to push an existing repository. Run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username and REPO_NAME with your repository name
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git

# Push your local repository to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

You might be prompted to authenticate with GitHub. Follow the prompts to complete the authentication.

## 3. Verify the push

1. Go to your GitHub repository page
2. Refresh the page to see your files
3. All your code should now be visible on GitHub

## 4. Future pushes

After making changes locally, you can push them to GitHub with:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Description of changes"
git push
```

## Troubleshooting

- If you get an authentication error, you may need to use a personal access token for authentication
- If you're unable to push, check if there are any updates on GitHub that you need to pull first
- If you encounter other issues, refer to GitHub's documentation or support
